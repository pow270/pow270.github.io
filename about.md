Capture The Flag (CTF) is a computer security wargame, where each participating individual or team competes to find the flag (key) by solving problems or hacking the prepared boxes. Usually, it involves many security fields, such as web hacking, binary reverse engineering, exploitation, forensics, cryptography, etc.
